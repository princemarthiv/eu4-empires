 northgerman_nation_title: "The question of a unified Germany"
 northgerman_nation_desc: "For centuries the German people have been unified in the state that is the Holy Roman Empire. However, over the states long reign it has lost nigh all of its control over its members. A successful general by the name of Otto von Bismarck has suggested to us that, with our powerbase in the north we could propose a confederation of the north German states, a valuable step which he says will put us on the path to unifying the German people under a true, unified, Germany."
